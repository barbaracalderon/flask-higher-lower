# EN: Flask: Guessing Game (Higher-Lower)


A **very simple** guess-the-number game with Flask Python.

The code here is mininum but enough to grasp the idea.


### Note
*Here's the thing: I was learning a bit about Flask, very introductory things, and was taking notes on it. I do this 
so I can come back to it later in whatever case I might need to refresh my memory. This very simple guess-the-number 
game was actually an exercise on this course I'm taking - you know, as a way to settle the content a little bit. So 
here it is. The course is from Dr. Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp and [my notes are here](https://github.com/barbaracalderon/notes-on-python/blob/main/05_FLASK.md).*

## Points

The point here is about:

1. To learn what is Flask
2. How to work with route variables
3. To make debug=True
4. To insert HTML tags
5. To complete the exercise

The point here is not about:

1. A beautiful HTML piece of work
2. UX/UI
3. An actual application to go live on the web

## Run `server.py`

You should see the entrance. 

Keep guessing the number as suggested in "HINT".

Try it yourself by changing the pictures or the content design.
